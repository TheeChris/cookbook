**Original Source:**: Veganomicon<br />
SERVES: 4<br />
TIME: 35 minutes

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cups seitan, sliced on teh diagnol into bite-size pieces
- 1 small onion, sliced into thick half-moons
- 2 cups sliced white or cremini mushrooms
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Several pinches of freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water
- 6 cups spinach, washed well
- Lemon slices (optional)

## Instructions
Preheat a large, lidded skillet over medium-high heat. Saute the seitan for about 2 minutes. Add the onions and saute for another 5 minutes, until softened, covering the pan but lifting it to stir occasionally to make the onions and seitan cook faster.

Add the mushrooms, garlic, thyme, basil, salt, and pepper, and saute for another 8 minutes, again, covering but occasionally stirring. Once the mushrooms are cooked and soft, add the wine and broth. Add the spinach in batches and use tongs to incorporate them with everything else. Cook for about 5 more minutes.

Serve immediately, with slices of lemon, if desired.
