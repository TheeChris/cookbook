# Udon with Shiitake Mushrooms and Kale in Miso Broth

**Original Source:** Veganomicon (Moskowitz, Romero)

SERVES: 4

**TIME:** 35 minutes

## Ingredients
- 1/2 pound fresh (or dried) udon noodles
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, sliced into half-moons
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons ginger, minced
- 2 tablespoons mirin (optional)
- 2 cups water
- 3 tablespoons miso
- 4 cups chopped kale
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce, or to taste

## Instructions
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the udon according to the package directions, about 10 minutes. When done, drain and rinse with cool water until ready to use.

Meanwhile, preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the onion and mushrooms in the oil for 5 to 7 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and the onions are softened but still have some crunch. Add the garlic and ginger, and saute for another minute.

Add the mirin, water, and miso, and bring to a gentle boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and add the kale. Toss the mixture around with tongs until the kale has wilted. Add the noodles and use a pasta spoon to stir them into the broth for about 2 minutes.

Divide the udon and vegetables among bowls and spoon some broth over each serving.
